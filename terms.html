                                Now” button or link on the Company’s website (the “Website”), followed by a completed
                                application form (if applicable) and all other Client information, the provision of
                                which may be required by the Company. The Client confirms that Client’s information is
                                full, accurate and complete. If there is a change in the information provided by the
                                Client, the Client must notify the Company immediately. </p>



                            <p>1.2 Usage of the Trading Platform Usage of the Trading Platform is made through the
                                Account by a limited license provided by the Company to the Client. The license is
                                personal, non-transferable and is for persons who are older than 18 years old (or older
                                legal age, if the law applicable to the Client’s jurisdictions requires a higher legal
                                age) and subject to this Agreement. The Client will not transfer, assign, or enable
                                other to make any use of the license, and/or give the Client’s access codes to the
                                Investment Account to anyone. Any damage caused to the Client, the Company and any third
                                party due to breach of this Agreement by Client, shall be under the Client’s sole
                                responsibility. </p>


                            <p>1.3 Activation of the Investment Account – The Account will be activated by the Company
                                as soon as the Company has identified the funds credited by the Client to the Investment
                                Account. The Company may activate the Investment Account and permit trading in the
                                Investment Account subject to such limitations, and to the satisfaction of such further
                                requirements as the Company may impose. Where a Investment Account is not activated or
                                is frozen, no funds held by the Company in respect of that Investment Account may be
                                transferred back or to any other person until the Company is satisfied that all
                                Applicable Regulations have been complied with.</p>


                            <p>1.4 The Company may act, according to the Company’s sole discretion, as principal or as
                                agent on the Client’s behalf in relation to any Transaction entered into pursuant to the
                                Agreement. Therefore the Company may act as the counter party to the Client’s trading
                                activity. The Client confirms that it acts as the sole principal and not as agent or
                                trustee on behalf of someone else. </p>

                            <p>
                                1.5 The Client hereby represents and warrants that his engagement with the Company in
                                this Agreement and his use of the Company’s services are in full compliance with the law
                                applicable to the Client.
                            </p>

                            <p>2.1 The Trading Platform enables Cryptocurrency Options trading in exchange rates of
                                different currencies, commodities, and any other financial instruments made available by
                                the Company. The Trading Platform displays indicative quotes of exchange rates of
                                different financial instruments pairs, based on different financial information systems,
                                as the most updated exchange rates in the international capital markets. For determining
                                the quotes for different time periods, the platform makes mathematical calculations
                                according to known and accepted capital markets formulas. It is acknowledged by both
                                Parties that due to different calculation methods and other circumstances, different
                                trading platforms and/or markets may display different price quotes. </p>


                            <p>2.2 The Client will receive a predetermined pay-out if their Cryptocurrency option
                                transaction expires in-the-money, and he will lose a predetermined amount of his
                                investment on the Transaction if the option expires out-of-the-money. The predetermined
                                amounts are a derivative of the collateral invested in the transaction by the Client,
                                and will be published on the Trading Platform. The degree to which the option is
                                in-the-money or out-of-the-money does not matter as it does with traditional options.
                            </p>


                            <p>2.3 The Client authorizes the Company to rely and act on any order, request, instruction
                                or other communication given or made (or purporting to be given or made) by the Client
                                or any person authorized on the Client’s behalf, without further inquiry on the part of
                                the Company as to the authenticity, genuineness authority or identity of the person

                                assumed by the Company on behalf of the Client in consequence of or in connection with
                                such orders, requests, instructions or other communication. </p>


                            <p>2.4 The Company reserves the right, but is not obligated to the following: to set, at its
                                absolute discretion, limits and/or parameters to control the Client’s ability to place
                                orders or to restrict the terms on which a Transaction may be made. Such limits and/or
                                parameters may be amended, increased, decreased, removed or added to by the Company.
                            </p>

                                2.5 Arbitrage/cancellation of orders and transactions – The Company does not allow
                                actions or non-actions by the Client or any person authorized on the Client’s behalf

                                connection with an error, system malfunction, breach of the Agreement by Client etc. The
                                Company’s records will serve as decisive evidence to the correct quotes of the world
                                capital markets and the incorrect quotes given to the Client; The Company is entitled to
                                correct or cancel any trade based on or according to.

                                2.6 Cancel Feature Abuse The Company offers a special cancellation feature that allows
                                traders to cancel a trade within a few seconds of execution. Abuse of the cancellation
                                feature can be considered market arbitrage and can result in forfeiture of profits.
                                Company reserves the right to cancel a position if the cancellation feature is abused.
                                The acceptable cancellation percentage cannot exceed 20% of the total number of executed
                                trades. Cancelling more than 20% of the total number of executed trades is considered
                                abuse of this feature and resulting profits may be forfeited from such abuse.

                                Company and will be treated as such for the purpose of securing or covering the Client’s

                                transferred to the Company, and the Company can deal with these funds in its own right.
                                In determining the amount of collateral and the amount of the Company’s obligations to
                                pay or return money to the Client, the Company may apply such methodology (including
